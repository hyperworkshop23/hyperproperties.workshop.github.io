<div class="w3-container " id="about"  style="font-weight: 200;  padding-left: 50px; padding-right: 50px; padding-top: 20px;">
      <p style=" line-height: 25px; font-size: 20px;">The study of hyperproperties has recently gained a great deal of attention in the formal methods, security, and cyber-physical systems communities. They have become a widely-used formalism for expressing system properties such as information-flow policies, symmetry in hardware design, robustness in cyber-physical systems, as well as properties of learning-enabled systems. The goal of this workshop is to foster the exchange of ideas on the topic of hyperproperties between researchers from these diverse communities and to present and discuss recent advances in formalisms and methods for specifying and analyzing hyperproperties. Topics of interest include,  but are not limited to,  developments on logical formalisms for specifying hyperproperties, algorithmic methodologies for the verification, synthesis, and runtime verification of hyperproperties, as well as applications related to the fields of cyber-physical systems, security and machine learning.
